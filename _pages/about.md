I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) where I lead the FOrmally Certified Automation and Learning (FOCAL) Lab. My current focus is on combining ideas from Formal Logic, Machine Learning, and Systems research to develop systematic and principled approaches (as opposed to "IT WORKS") for **constructing intelligent compute systems with formal guarantees about their behavior and safety**. Our group has received the **NSF Career Award**, **Google Research Scholar Award**, and **Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship**. Some of the topics (in alphabetical order) that we currently work on are 
<ul>
  <li> Deep Learning for Systems</li>
   <li>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</li>
  <li>Explainable AI</li>
  <li>Federated Learning</li> 
    <li> Logic-guided Learning</li>
 <li>Machine Learning for Wireless</li>
    <li>Neural Network Verification </li> 
    <li>NeuroSymbolic Program Analysis</li>
   <li>Out-of-Distribution Generalization</li>
   <li>Safety of Large Language Models</li> 

  
  <li>Static Analysis of Differentiable Programs </li> 
 
 
</ul>

I obtained a PhD in Computer Science from ETH Zurich in 2020 working with <a href="https://acl.inf.ethz.ch/people/markusp/">Prof. Markus PÃ¼schel</a> and <a href="https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/people/martin"> Prof. Martin Vechev</a>. During my PhD, I designed scalable and precise automated reasoning methods and tools for programs and deep neural networks. I co-received the **ACM SIGPLAN Doctoral Dissertation Award** given annually to the best dissertations in the area of Programming Languages. Before that, I completed a Masters in Computer Science at ETH in 2014 receiving the **ETH Master Medal** and Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Patna in 2012 receiving the **President of India Gold Medal**. 

**For prospective PhD candidates**: Please apply to the <a href="https://grad.illinois.edu/admissions/apply">UIUC CS graduate program </a> and mention my name. I will get back to you if there is a good match.
