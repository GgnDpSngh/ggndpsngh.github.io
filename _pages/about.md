I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I also hold an Affiliated Researcher position with VMware Research. My current focus is on combining ideas from Formal Logic, Machine Learning, and Systems research to **construct intelligent compute systems with formal guarantees about their behavior and safety**. I obtained a PhD in Computer Science from ETH Zurich in 2020 working with <a href="https://acl.inf.ethz.ch/people/markusp/">Prof. Markus PÃ¼schel</a> and <a href="https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/people/martin"> Prof. Martin Vechev</a>. During my PhD, I designed scalable and precise automated reasoning methods and tools for programs and deep neural networks. I co-received the **ACM SIGPLAN Doctoral Dissertation Award** given annually to the best dissertations in the area of Programming Languages. Before that, I completed a Masters in Computer Science at ETH in 2014 receiving the **ETH Master Medal** and Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Patna in 2012 receiving the **President of India Gold Medal**. 

I am looking for focused, confident, and ambitious PhD students with strong background in both theory and practice to work on projects at the intersection of formal logic, machine learning, and systems. If you believe you have these qualities and are interested in working with us, please apply to the <a href="https://grad.illinois.edu/admissions/apply">UIUC CS graduate program </a> and send me an <a href="mailto:ggnds@illinois.edu"><i class="fas fa-envelope zoom" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>.

**I am Co-Chairing the <a href="https://2022.splashcon.org/home/sas-2022"> 29th Static Analysis Symposium</a>, one of the best venues for static analysis, along with <a href="https://caterinaurban.github.io/"> Caterina Urban</a>. Consider submitting your best work!**
