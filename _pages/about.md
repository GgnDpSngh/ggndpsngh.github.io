I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My current focus is on combining ideas from Formal Logic, Machine Learning, and Systems research to **construct intelligent compute systems with formal guarantees about their behavior, fairness, and safety**. I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science from ETH Zurich in 2020, where I designed scalable and precise automated reasoning methods and tools for programs and deep neural networks. My PhD thesis was the co-winner of the **John C. Reynolds Doctoral Dissertation Award** awarded annually to the best dissertations in the area of Programming Languages. Before that, I completed a Masters in Computer Science at ETH in 2014 receiving the **ETH Master Medal** and Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Patna in 2012 receiving the **President of India Gold Medal**. 

I am looking for Ph.D. students with strong background in both theory and practice to work with me on projects at the intersection of formal reasoning, machine learning, and systems.
