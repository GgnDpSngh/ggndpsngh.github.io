I will be starting as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) from Fall 2021. I am currently working with <a href="https://research.vmware.com/">VMware Research</a>. My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and programming languages. My long term goal is to design end-to-end automated formal reasoning tools for real-world systems with both software and AI components such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and AI-powered healthcare devices. I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science from ETH Zurich in 2020, where I designed scalable and precise automated reasoning tools for programs and deep neural networks. Previously, I completed a Masters in Computer Science at ETH in 2014 and Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Patna in 2012. 

I am looking for Ph.D. students with strong background in both theory and systems to work with me on topics spanning the intersection of automated reasoning, machine learning, and systems. If you are interested, please apply to the <a href="https://grad.illinois.edu/admissions/apply">UIUC CS graduate program </a> and send me an <a href="mailto:ggnds@illinois.edu"><i class="fas fa-envelope zoom" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>.
