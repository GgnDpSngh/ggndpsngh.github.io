I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and programming languages. My long term goal is to construct intelligent software-based systems with formal guarantees. I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science from ETH Zurich in 2020, where I designed scalable and precise automated reasoning methods and tools for programs and deep neural networks. My <a href="https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/445921?show=full"> PhD thesis </a> was the co-winner of the <a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Awards/Dissertation/"> John C. Reynolds Doctoral Dissertation Award</a> awarded annually to the best dissertations in the area of programming languages. Before that, I completed a Masters in Computer Science at ETH in 2014 receiving the ETH Master Medal and Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Patna in 2012 receiving the President of India Gold Medal. 

I am looking for Ph.D. students with strong background in both theory and practice to work with me on projects at the intersection of formal reasoning, machine learning, and systems.
