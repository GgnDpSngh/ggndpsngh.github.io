<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  Given the black-box nature of the state-of-the-art AI models and the lack of associated formal guarantees, there is a growing interest in using formal methods for AI-based systems to ensure their reliability and interpretability. 
  This direction is a key component of the so-called “Third wave of AI”. Similarly, there is a growing interest in leveraging data-driven machine learning for knowledge discovery and boosting logical inference. 
  This course will introduce recent developments in both directions and outline several promising future research directions. Overall, the students will be exposed to the following topics:
</p>


<ul>

  <li> White and black-box adversarial examples </li> 
<li>Training and querying with logic</li>
<li>Verification of AI systems</li>
<li>Robust training methods</li>
<li>Machine learning for verification</li>
<li>Symbolic explanations of neural networks</li>
  <li>Programming by example</li>
<li>Neurosymbolic computing </li>
<li>Probabilistic circuits</li>

</ul>
