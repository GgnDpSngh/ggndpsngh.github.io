<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
 Emerging ML models (like deep neural networks) tend to be complex, fragile, non-robust, and uninterpretable. This makes it extremely challenging to build reliable real-world systems that incorporate ML components. We need trustworthy ML as well as robust system design to achieve end-to-end correctness of systems.
In this course, we will study recent developments at the intersection of formal methods (FM), programming languages (PL) and machine learning (ML) research towards the development of trustworthy AI-based systems. Some topics planned covered for the course are:
</p>


<ul>

<li>Formal Verification of ML models using abstraction and constraint solvers</li>
<li>Symbolic explanations of deep neural networks</li>
<li>Training ML models with Logic and Knowledge</li>
<li>Learning symbolic concepts (code, program synthesis, invariants)</li>
  <li>Proving correctness of systems with ML components</li>
	<li>Neurosymbolic machine learning</li>



</ul>
The course will be taught in person.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
Students should have taken CS173 (or a similar course) and know basic proofs using induction and proof by contradiction (as taught in CS173). Some background on computability theory (as taught is CS374) and machine learning (like CS446) would be good.

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

The students will work in a group of 2 or individually on:
<ul>
	<li> a course project, </li>
	<li> conference-style paper presentation on one of the topics taught in the course towards the end of the semester (see dates above). The students are free to select any paper, but it must be approved by us.</li>
	</ul>

Both project and presentation will make up 50 % of the grade each.
