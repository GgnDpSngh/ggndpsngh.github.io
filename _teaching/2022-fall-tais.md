<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
 Emerging ML models (like deep neural networks) tend to be complex, fragile, non-robust, and uninterpretable. This makes it extremely challenging to build reliable real-world systems that incorporate ML components. We need trustworthy ML as well as robust system design to achieve end-to-end correctness of systems.
In this course, we will study recent developments at the intersection of formal methods (FM), programming languages (PL) and machine learning (ML) research towards the development of trustworthy AI-based systems. Some topics planned covered for the course are:
</p>


<ul>

<li>Formal Verification of ML models using abstraction and constraint solvers</li>
<li>Symbolic explanations of deep neural networks</li>
<li>Training ML models with Logic and Knowledge</li>
<li>Learning symbolic concepts (code, program synthesis, invariants)</li>
  <li>Proving correctness of systems with ML components</li>
	<li>Neurosymbolic machine learning</li>



</ul>
The course will be taught in person.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
Students should have taken CS173 (or a similar course) and know basic proofs using induction and proof by contradiction (as taught in CS173). Some background on computability theory (as taught is CS374) and machine learning (like CS446) would be good.

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Homeworks (50%): There will be 5 homeworks involving theory and coding during the semester roughly once every two weeks. We will consider the 4 homeworks where you get the highest score for grading. Each graded homework accounts for 12.5% of the grade. The deadline for submitting your solutions to the homeworks will be one week from the date the homework is posted on Piazza. Late submissions will not be accepted. </li>
	<li>Project (40%): There will be a course project based on the material covered in the class. You can also specify your own project but it must be approved by us.</li>
	<li>Participation (10%): Your attendance for lectures and participation on Piazza will account for 10% of the grades.</li>
	</ul>
